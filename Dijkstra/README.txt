Dijkstra's algorithm was implemented using Python 3.8, although most other versions of Python 3.x should work.

With Python 3.8 installed, navigate to the Dijkstra folder and type:
    Linux:      python3 Dijkstra_run.py
    Windows:    python Dijkstra_run.py

The algorithm is expecting the input files to be the exact format seen in graph1 and graph2.
Any additional graphs need to use the same spacing and limited to 1 matrix per file
