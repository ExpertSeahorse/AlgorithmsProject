DFS:
    To run dfs8puzzle.py the files board1.txt and board2.txt should be in the same directory as dfs8puzzle.py
    To run the program select either board1 or board2 by typing 1 followed by the enter key for board 1 or type 2 followed by the enter key for board 2

Dijkstra:
    Dijkstra's algorithm was implemented using Python 3.8, although most other versions of Python 3.x should work.

    With Python 3.8 installed, navigate to the Dijkstra folder and type:
        Linux:      python3 Dijkstra_run.py
        Windows:    python Dijkstra_run.py

    The algorithm is expecting the input files to be the exact format seen in graph1 and graph2.
    Any additional graphs need to use the same spacing and limited to 1 matrix per file
